- PHASE_3_COMPLETE.md
- PHASE_4_COMPLETE.md

- V2_README.md

### Active Documentation (Kept in Root)

**Current State:**
- README.md - Main project overview
- PROGRESS.md - Current development status
- ARCHITECTURE.md - System architecture
- GAME_MECHANICS.md - How the game works

**Planning:**
- ROADMAP.md - Future work streams (NEW)
- FEATURE_SPEC.md - Detailed feature specifications
- LEVEL_DESIGN.md - World design concepts
- TECHNICAL_DEBT.md - Known issues to address

**Development:**
- CONTRIBUTING.md - How to contribute
- TESTING.md - Testing strategy

## Rationale

Archived files were either:
1. **Completed phases** - Historical records of past work
2. **Superseded plans** - Replaced by current roadmap
3. **One-time reports** - Bug fixes and implementation summaries
4. **Outdated specs** - No longer reflect current architecture

These are preserved in `docs/archive/` for reference but removed from root to reduce clutter.

## Next Steps

See ROADMAP.md for the three major work streams:
1. Level Design
2. Level Creation
3. Swap Connection

Plus 9 additional work streams identified for the project.
